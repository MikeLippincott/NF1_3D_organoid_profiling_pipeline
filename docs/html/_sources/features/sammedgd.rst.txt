===================
SAM-Med3D Features
===================

Description
===========

SAM-Med3D features are derived from Segment Anything Model - Medical 3D
(SAM-Med3D), a foundation model for 3D medical image segmentation.

Purpose
=======

SAM-Med3D features provide:

* Deep learning-based segmentation masks
* Pre-trained feature representations
* Segmentation confidence metrics
* Alternative segmentation approaches

Current Status
==============

This feature category stores segmentation outputs from SAM-Med3D:

* 3D segmentation masks
* Probabilistic segmentation maps
* Segmentation confidence scores

Future Development
==================

Planned extensions include:

* Fine-tuned SAM-Med3D models for organoid data
* Feature extraction from learned representations
* Comparison with traditional segmentation methods
* Integration with other foundation models
