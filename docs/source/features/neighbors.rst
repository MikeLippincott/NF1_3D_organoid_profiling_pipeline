Neighbors Features
================

Description
===========

Neighbors features quantify spatial relationships and adjacency patterns
between segmented objects within the image volume.

Current Implementation
======================

The neighbors feature set currently captures:

* Object-to-object proximity measurements
* Spatial adjacency statistics

Total Features
--------------

Currently **2 neighbors features** are extracted per image set.

Future Extensions
=================

This feature category is designed for expansion to include:

* Number of neighboring objects
* Distance to nearest neighbor
* Contact surface area metrics
* 3D spatial arrangement patterns
* Clustering coefficients

Applications
=============

Neighbors features support analysis of:

* Tissue organization and architecture
* Cell-cell interactions
* Spatial clustering patterns
* Developmental organization
